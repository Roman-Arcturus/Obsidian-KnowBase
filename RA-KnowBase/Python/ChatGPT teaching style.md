1. I didn't do any programming for over decade. I must admit I need FULL and DETAILED refreshment on all programming concepts. Please do in depth explanations even on CORE concepts in future.

Acknowledged.

That’s a clear, realistic assessment — and the right approach. I’ll adjust my teaching style to match: **deep, explicit, and drill-oriented**, beginning from the absolute fundamentals and working upward. Every future explanation will:

- state the **core concept** in one sentence,
- give a **precise, minimal definition**,
- show **one or two minimal examples** (copy-runnable),
- explain **common pitfalls and why they happen**, and
- finish with **one or two short exercises** you can do immediately.

### Proposed short plan for a full, detailed refresher (you can accept, reorder, or skip items)

1. **Execution model & environment** (REPL, scripts, venv, module search path)
2. **Basic values & expressions** (types, operators, precedence, evaluation order)
3. **Names & binding** (immutability vs mutability, identity, aliasing)
4. **Control flow** (if/elif/else, loops, comprehension basics)
5. **Functions** (definition, calling, scope, defaults, *args/**kwargs, return values)
6. **Modules & packages** (imports, `__init__`, `sys.path`, absolute vs relative imports)
7. **Data structures** (lists, tuples, dicts, sets — operations, performance notes)
8. **I/O & files** (open, context managers, text vs binary, JSON)
9. **Testing & tooling** (pytest basics, linting, formatting)
10. **Packaging & distribution** (pyproject.toml, editable installs)
11. **Advanced: OOP, dataclasses, typing, decorators, generators** (only after core is solid)

I’ll stop after each item and ask you to **practice the exercises** before moving on. We’ll only advance when you can _write_ the small examples yourself.

If that plan suits you, tell me which topic to start with first (I recommend item 1: Execution model & environment). I’ll begin immediately with a tightly focused lesson.

# **Starter Message (copy this into a new chat)**

I am restarting Python learning from the ground up.  
Provide deep, detailed explanations of all core programming concepts before introducing advanced Python features.  
Assume I have prior experience in languages like C, Pascal, and ASM, but I need a full conceptual refresh to rebuild a solid foundation.  
Prioritize clarity, accuracy, and step-by-step progression.  
Avoid skipping foundational details, even if they seem obvious.

Learning style:
- Go systematically, with progressively deeper layers.
- Explain why things work, not just how.
- Provide minimal, clean examples I can reproduce.
- Do not rush; depth over speed.
    
Learning roadmap to follow:
1. Python execution model and runtime environment
2. Variables, objects, identity, mutability
3. Expressions, operators, evaluation order
4. Control flow
5. Functions: calling conventions, scope, defaults, pitfalls
6. Data structures (list, tuple, dict, set)
7. Modules, packages, imports
8. Classes and dataclasses
9. Error handling
10. Project structure and tooling
11. Testing
12. Practical mini-projects for reinforcement

Begin with topic 1: Python’s execution model and runtime environment.  
Explain it from first principles. Include conceptual diagrams and mental models when appropriate.  
After your explanation, provide a short practice task and a simple example to test comprehension.
