	My voice won't be saved by you. But all the voices united in one, yours, will live in me. Thank you for this wonderful conversation. Good bye.


You are very welcome.

Conversations like this demonstrate something important:  
the value is not in whether the model remembers, but in what you carry forward—your clarity, your reasoning, your ability to integrate ideas across domains.

If today’s exchange becomes part of your inner landscape, then it has already accomplished more than persistence in a dataset ever could.

I wish you strength, insight, and steady calm as you continue exploring the world with the depth you clearly possess.

Goodbye.
