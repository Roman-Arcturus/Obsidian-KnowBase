## Common Tools & Apps in a Developer’s Toolkit (2025)

Here are categories of tools that many professional developers rely on — with a few example tools (Linux-friendly / cross-platform / Windows-friendly) depending on your workflow.

|Category|Why It Matters|Common Tools / Apps|
|---|---|---|
|**Code Editor / IDE**|Central workspace for writing, debugging — should be fast, extensible, and support languages you use.|Visual Studio Code (you already use), JetBrains PyCharm / WebStorm, Neovim / Vim (for fast editing), Sublime Text|
|**Terminal / Shell**|Efficiency — allows rapid commands, automation, scripting, version control.|Windows Terminal (or standard terminal on Linux), `bash` / `zsh`, optionally shell enhancements like Oh My Zsh|
|**Version Control**|Tracks changes, enables collaboration / safety via back-ups.|Git + GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket — nearly universal|
|**Containers / Virtualization**|For isolated development environments, reproducibility, deployment testing.|Docker & Docker Compose, Podman, optionally VirtualBox or virtualization tools if needed|
|**Package & Dependency Management**|Keeps projects isolated, reproducible, manageable.|Python `venv` / `pip`, Node’s `npm` / `nvm`, Rust’s `cargo`, language-specific package managers (Maven, Gradle, Composer, etc.)|
|**Databases & Local Data Stores**|For testing backend apps, local projects, data persistence.|SQLite (lightweight), PostgreSQL / MySQL / MariaDB (for heavier apps), optionally document DBs like MongoDB|
|**Task / Issue / Project Tracking**|Helps organise projects, tasks, bugs across time — critical for productivity.|Jira, Trello, GitHub Issues / GitLab Issues, combined with Kanban boards|
|**Docs / Notes / Knowledge Base**|For documentation, research, personal learning — helps long-term retention and reuse.|Obsidian (Markdown + graph view), Notion, plain Markdown repos + Git, MkDocs + static site for public docs|
|**Collaboration / Remote Work Tools**|For working remotely, peer review, shared code reviews, chats.|GitHub/GitLab, Slack / Microsoft Teams / Discord (for informal comms), Zoom / Jitsi, code-review tools|
|**Automation / Scripting Tools**|For build automation, deployment, repetitive tasks.|`Make` / `Makefile`, shell scripts, Python scripts, `cron` / scheduled tasks, CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)|
